# ShowBlocks

ShowBlocks is an educational game meant to make learning SQL more active and intuitive! It provides an SQL sandbox that allows users to actively see the effects of queries on their databases.

The currently available version of ShowBlocks is a proof of concept, as there are a lot of areas still being worked on, in order to make ShowBlocks the best possible game it can be!
